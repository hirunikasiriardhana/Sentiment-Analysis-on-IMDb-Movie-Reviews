# Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDb-Movie-Reviews
This project involves building a sentiment analysis model to classify IMDb movie reviews as positive or negative. Using the Kaggle dataset "IMDB Dataset.csv", we preprocess the text data by removing stop words and special characters, then tokenize and pad the sequences. An LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is created using Keras and TensorFlow, and trained on the processed data. The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy and classification reports. Finally, the model is tested with new reviews to predict their sentiment, demonstrating its capability to generalize to unseen data.
